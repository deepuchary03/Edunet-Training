      Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science focused on
      creating machines that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence,
      such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI systems use
      data and advanced algorithms to recognize patterns, understand language,
      and make predictions or recommendations, allowing them to automate complex
      tasks and operate more autonomously. Applications range from personalizing
      recommendations and powering virtual assistants to enabling self-driving
      cars and assisting in medical diagnosis
